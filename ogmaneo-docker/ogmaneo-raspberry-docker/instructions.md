# EOgmaNeo Raspberry Pi3 Self-Driving Car 
## Docker image containing dependencies of EOgmaDrive for Raspberry Pi3 Stretch 
 
This is a Docker image of required dependencies compiled for the Raspberry Pi for [EOgmaDrive's Configuration1 self-driving car](https://github.com/ogmacorp/EOgmaDrive/tree/master/Configuration1). 

[Here](https://github.com/ylustina/sdc-EOgmaNeo) is the link to my self-driving car repository which has the materials necessary, car assembly instructions, and the project code for the car I made.

--------------


This Docker image uses resin.io Raspberry Pi base images and contains:

- OpenCV - Forked [rpi-raspbian-docker](https://github.com/sgtwilko/rpi-raspbian-opencv) for OpenCV 3.4.1.
- EOgmaNeo - installed for Python 3 only
- Numpy
- PyGame
- Pillow
- Jupyter
- PySerial
- Nano
- Ino
- Wheel


<a name="controller"/>

## Controller Installation 

Install the Steam controller on the Pi, outside of the Docker container. 


	sudo apt install python3
	git clone https://github.com/ynsta/steamcontroller.git
	cd steamcontroller
	sudo python3 setup.py install 
	
For reference, Standalone Steam controller driver repository [here](https://github.com/ynsta/steamcontroller). 
	


In `sudo nano /etc/udev/rules.d/99-steam-controller.rules` write:

	# replace game group by a valid group on your system
	# Steam controller keyboard/mouse mode
	SUBSYSTEM=="usb", ATTRS{idVendor}=="28de", GROUP="games", MODE="0660"

	# Steam controller gamepad mode
	KERNEL=="uinput", MODE="0660", GROUP="games", OPTIONS+="static_node=uinput"


Reload and reboot the Pi: 

	sudo udevadm control --reload
	sudo reboot


Upon reboot, start the controller:

	python3 ~/steamcontroller/scripts/sc-xbox.py start
	

PUSH A BUTTON! :) Or else the controller will not be recognized.

To see if the controller is on the Pi:

	ls /dev/input/

Should show /dev/usb/js01


#### Remember to push a button on the controller on reboot and after starting the daemon!!! ####





<a name="docker"/>

## Installing Docker on the Pi 

	cd ~
	curl -fsSL get.docker.com -o get-docker.sh
	sudo sh get-docker.sh
	sudo usermod -aG docker pi

Exit, and then ssh back in. 

Pull the latest [Docker image](https://hub.docker.com/r/ylustina/sdc-docker/):

	docker pull ylustina/sdc-docker:latest

Make a directory on the Pi for a folder that will be shared with the Docker container:

	mkdir shared-with-docker

To run the Docker container:

	docker run -ti --privileged \
		-e DISPLAY=$DISPLAY \
		-v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix:ro \
		-v /home/pi/shared-with-docker/:/root/ \
		-p 8888:8888 \
		ylustina/sdc-docker:latest /bin/bash


You will be able to get the Docker container running automatically on reboot at [this stage](#automatic), but first install the software for your Arduino.





<a name="arduino"/>

## Installing Ino and Arduino 


in your drive folder:

	apt install arduino
	ino build 
	ino upload 


To check if your Arduino is plugged in:

	ls /dev/serial/by-id/
	
	
Location of the Arduino: 

	readlink -f /dev/serial/by-id/usb-Arduino* 
	




<a name="run"/>

## Run the Docker Container 

To run the Docker container:

	docker run -ti --privileged \
		-e DISPLAY=$DISPLAY \
		-v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix:ro \
		-v /home/pi/shared-with-docker/:/root/ \
		-p 8888:8888 \
		ylustina/sdc-docker:latest /bin/bash
		


<a name="clone"/>

## Clone SDC Repo Inside the Container 


	cd ~
	git clone https://github.com/ylustina/sdc-EOgmaNeo.git
	exit
	



<a name="automatic"/>

## Start the Steam Controller

Edit rc.local outside container. This will start the Steam controller when the Pi turns on.

	sudo nano /etc/rc.local


Before `exit 0` place the following following line:

	python3 /home/pi/steamcontroller/scripts/sc-xbox.py start &
	
	exit 0


## Start the container automatically

	docker run -dti --privileged \
	       -e DISPLAY=$DISPLAY \
	       -v /tmp/.X11-unix:/tmp/.X11-unix:ro \
	       -v /home/pi/shared-with-docker/:/root/ \
	       -p 8888:8888 \
	       --restart always \
	       ylustina/sdc-docker:latest python3 /root/sdc-EOgmaNeo/self-driving\ car/pi_sdc.py


Now the Pi will run the self-driving car file on startup! Make sure the controller is plugged in and running (don't forget to push a button on startup).

# Notes to self for building the Docker Image

Needed a minimum of a 16GB SDCard, 32GB recommended and more than 7GB of free space.

Assuming you already have docker working on your system you will then need to increase the swap size on the RPi.  
To do this you will need to edit `/etc/dphys-swapfile`.

Comment out the line:
`#CONF_SWAPSIZE=100`
and uncomment and edit the remaining lines as follows:

	# set size to computed value, this times RAM size, dynamically adapts,
	#   guarantees that there is enough swap without wasting disk space on excess
	CONF_SWAPFACTOR=1
	
	# restrict size (computed and absolute!) to maximally this limit
	#   can be set to empty for no limit, but beware of filled partitions!
	#   this is/was a (outdated?) 32bit kernel limit (in MBytes), do not overrun it
	#   but is also sensible on 64bit to prevent filling /var or even / partition
	CONF_MAXSWAP=4096

Then remember to restart the swap service:

	$ sudo /etc/init.d/dphys-swapfile stop
	$ sudo /etc/init.d/dphys-swapfile start

Without this, the RPi will run out of RAM and will crash at around 86% during the build.

During building your RPi will run at 100% CPU for an extended amount of time: it will run hot. I wouldn't recommend trying to build without a Heatsink, a fan is not necessary, but will speed up the process as the CPU will slow down as it reaches/exceeds 80Â°C.

A basic build will take between 2 and 4 hours on a RPi 3B, and can be kicked off by:

	$ git clone https://github.com/ylustina/sdc-docker.git
	$ cd sdc-docker
	$ docker build -t sdc-docker .

The `-t` parameter is providing the tag you'll use to identify this image.
